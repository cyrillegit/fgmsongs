    <verse>Onward, Christian soldiers! Marching as to war,## Looking unto Jesus, who is gone before.## Christ, the Royal Master, leads against the foe;## Forward into battle see His banners go.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Onward, Christian soldiers! ## Marching as to war,## Looking unto Jesus, ## who is gone before.</verse>
    <verse>At the name of Jesus satan's host doth flee;## On then, Christian soldiers, on to victory!## Hell's foundations quiver at the shout of praise:## Brothers, lift your voices, loud your anthems raise!</verse>
    <verse>Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane,## But the Church of Jesus constant will remain:## Gates of hell can never 'gainst that Church prevail;## We have Christ's own promise, and that cannot fail.</verse>
    <verse>Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng;## Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song:## Glory, praise and honour unto Christ the King,## This through countless ages men and angels sing.</verse>
