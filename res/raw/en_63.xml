    <verse>Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,## The King of creation!## O my soul, praise Him## For He is thy health and salvation!## All ye who hear,## Now to His temple draw near,## Praise Him in glad adoration.</verse>
    <verse>Praise to the Lord, who o`er## All things so wondrously reigneth,## Shelters thee under His wings,## Yea, so gently sustaineth## Hast thou not seen## How thy desires e`er have been## Granted in what He ordaineth?</verse>
    <verse>Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper## Thy work and defend thee,## Surely His goodness and mercy## Here daily attend thee.## Ponder anew## What the Almighty can do,## If with His love He befriend thee.</verse>
