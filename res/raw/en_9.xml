    <verse>A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord,## A wonderful Saviour to me;## He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,## Where rivers of pleasure I see.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,## That shadows a dry, thirsty land;## He hideth my life with the depths of His love,## And covers me there with His hand. (bis)</verse>
    <verse>A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord## He taketh my burden away;## He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,## He giveth me strength as my day.</verse>
    <verse>With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,## And filled with His goodness divine,## I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God## For such a Redeemer as mine.</verse>
    <verse>When clothed in His brightness transported I rise## To meet Him in clouds of the sky,## His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,## I'll shout with the millions on high.</verse>
