    <verse>I am so glad that our Father in heaven## Tells of His love in the Book He has given,## Wonderful things in the Bible I see;## This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : I am so glad that Jesus loves me,## Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me,## I am so glad that Jesus loves me,## Jesus loves even me.</verse>
    <verse>Though I forget Him and wander away,## Still He doth love me wherever I stray;## Back to His dear loving arms would I flee,## When I remember that Jesus loves me.</verse>
    <verse>Jesus loves me and I know I love Him,## Love brought Him down my poor soul to redeem;## Yes it was love made Him die on the tree;## Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me.</verse>
    <verse>If one should ask of me how I can tell;## Glory to Jesus I know very well!## Godâ€™s Holy Spirit with mine doth agree,## Constantly witnessing Jesus loves me.</verse>
    <verse>Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,## When in His beauty I see the great King,## This shall my song in eternity be:## "Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me."</verse>
