    <verse>Revive Thy work, O Lord!## Now to Thy saints appear!## Oh, speak with powâ€™r to every soul,## And let Thy people hear!</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Revive Thy work, O Lord!## While here to Thee we bow;## Descend, O gracious Lord, descend!## Oh come, and bless us now!</verse>
    <verse> Revive Thy work, O Lord!## Exalt Thy precious name!## And may Thy love in every heart## Be kindled to a flame!</verse>
    <verse>Revive Thy work, O Lord!## And bless to all Thy word!## And may its pure and sacred truth## In living faith be heard!</verse>
    <verse>Revive Thy work, O Lord!## Give Pentecostal showers!## Be Thine the glory, Thine alone!## The blessing, Lord, be ours!</verse>
