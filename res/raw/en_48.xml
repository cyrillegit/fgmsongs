<song>
    <verse>Far, far away in heathen darkness dwelling,## Millions of souls forever may be lost;## Who, who will go salvation’s story telling,## Looking to Jesus, counting not the cost?</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : "All power is given unto Me!## Go ye into all the world## And preach the Gospel;## And lo, I am with you always."</verse>
    <verse>See, o’er the world, wide open doors inviting;## Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!## Christians, awake! Your forces all uniting,## Send forth the Gospel, break the chains of sin!</verse>
    <verse>"Why will ye die?" The voice of God is calling;## "Why will ye die?" Re-echo in His name;## Jesus has died to save from death appalling;## Life and salvation therefore go proclaim.</verse>
    <verse>God speed the day when those of every nation,## "Glory to God" triumphantly shall sing;## Ransomed, redeemed, rejoicing in salvation,## Shout, "Alleluia! For the Lord is King."</verse>
