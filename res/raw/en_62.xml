    <verse>When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound## And time shall be no more,## And the morning breaks eternal, bright and fair;## When the saved of earth shall gather## Over on the other shore,## And the roll is called up yonder,## I’ll be there.</verse>
    <verse>When the roll is called up yonder, (x3)## When the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.</verse>
    <verse> On that bright and cloudless morning,## When the dead in Christ shall rise,## And the glory of His resurrection share;## When His chosen ones shall gather## To their homes beyond the skies,## And the roll is called up yonder,## I’ll be there.</verse>
    <verse>Let me labour for the Master## From the dawn till setting sun,## Let me talk of all His wondrous love and care,## Then when all of life is over,## And my work on earth is done,## And the roll is called up yonder,## I’ll be there.</verse>
