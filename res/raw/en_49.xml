    <verse>Stand up, stand up for Jesus! Ye soldiers of the cross;## Lift high His royal banner, it must not suffer loss.## From vict'ry unto vict'ry His army shall He lead,## Till every foe is vanquished, and Christ is Lord indeed.</verse>
    <verse>Stand up, stand up for Jesus! The trumpet call obey;## Forth to the mighty conflict in this His glorious day!## Ye that are men, now serve Him, against unnumbered foes;## Let courage rise with danger, and strength to strength oppose!</verse>
    <verse>Stand up, stand up for Jesus! Stand in His strength alone;## The arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own;## Put on the Gospel armour, and watching unto prayer;## Where duty calls, or danger, be never wanting there.</verse>
    <verse>Stand up, stand up for Jesus! The strife will not be long;## This day the noise of battle, the next the victor's song;## To him that overcometh, a crown of life shall be;## He with the King of glory shall reign eternally. </verse>
