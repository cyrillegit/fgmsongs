    <verse>Thou Christ of burning, cleansing flame,## Send the fire! (x3)## Thy blood-bought gift today we claim.## Send the fire! (x3)## Look down and see this waiting host,## Send us the promised Holy Ghost!## We want another Pentecost.## Send the fire! (x3)</verse>
    <verse>God of Elijah, hear our cry.## Send the fire! (x3)## He'll make us fit to live or die.## Send the fire! (x3)## To burn up every trace of sin,## To bring the light and glory in;## The revolution now begin.## Send the fire! (x3)</verse>
    <verse>'Tis fire we want, for fire we plead.## Send the fire! (x3)## The fire will meet our ev'ry need.## Send the fire! (x3)## For strength to always do the right,## For grace to conquer in the fight,## For pow'r to walk the world in white,## Send the fire! (x3)</verse>
