    <verse>"There shall be showers of blessing:"## This is the promise of love;## There shall be seasons refreshing,## Sent from the Saviour above.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Showers of blessing,## Showers of blessing we need;## Mercy-drops round us are falling,## But for the showers we plead.</verse>
    <verse>There shall be showers of blessing,## Precious reviving again;## Over the hills and the valleys,## Sound of abundance of rain.</verse>
    <verse>There shall be showers of blessing!## Send them upon us, O Lord!## Grant to us now a refreshing;## Come, and now honor Thy word!</verse>
    <verse>There shall be showers of blessing!## Oh that today they might fall,## Now as to God we're confessing,## Now as on Jesus we call.</verse>
