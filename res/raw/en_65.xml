    <verse>O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder,## Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made;## I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,## Thy power throughout the universe displayed:## Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,## "How great Thou art!" (x2)</verse>
    <verse>When through the woods and forest glades I wander,## And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;## When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,## And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze;## Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,## "How great Thou art!" (x2)</verse>
    <verse>And when I think that God His Son not sparing,## Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;## That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,## He bled and died to take away my sin.## Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,## "How great Thou art!" (x2)</verse>
    <verse>When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation## And take me home what joy shall feel my heart.## Then I shall bow in humble adoration## And there proclaim my God how great Thou art.## Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,## "How great Thou art!" (x2)</verse>
