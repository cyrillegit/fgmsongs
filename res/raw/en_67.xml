    <verse>Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,## There is no shadow of turning with Thee;## Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;## As Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Great is Thy faithfulness! (x2)## Morning by morning new mercies I see;## All I have needed Thy hand hath provided.## Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!</verse>
    <verse>Summer and winter and spring-time and harvest,## Sun, moon and stars in their courses above## Join with all nature in manifold witness,## To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.</verse>
    <verse>Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,## Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;## Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,## Blessing all mine, with ten thousand beside!</verse>
