    <verse>Suffâ€™ring, dying on the cross of Calvary,## Jesus set me free from satan's slavery;## Washing sin and shame away,## Cleansing heart and soul to stay## In forever, making me a child of God.</verse>
    <verse> Therefore come, friend, come along with me! ## Therefore come, friend, come along with me!## Therefore come, O friend, come!## Sinner, walk with me the narrow road of life!</verse>
    <verse>What the Lord has done for me on Calvary,## Brought salvation throughout all eternity.## Though the devil still may fight,## Jesus conquers at my side:## Nothing ever shall destroy my faith in God.</verse>
    <verse> Worldly pleasures, earthly follies be ye gone;## Satisfaction and true gladness grant ye none.## I will walk the narrow road## That my Lord before me trod,## Though it be the way of suff'ring and the cross</verse>
    <verse>Soon, one day, my race of faith on earth will end;## Gladly then my knees before my Lord I'll bend.## Then rejoicing I shall see## Throughout all eternity## Him whose love, so great, has dying purchased me.</verse>
