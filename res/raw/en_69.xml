    <verse>I know not why God’s wondrous grace## To me He hath made known,## Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love,## Redeemed me for His own.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : But I know whom I have believèd,## And am persuaded that He is able## To keep that which I’ve committed## Unto Him against that day.</verse>
    <verse>I know not how this saving faith## To me He did impart,## Nor how believing in His word## Wrought peace within my heart.</verse>
    <verse>I know not what of good or ill## May be reserved for me,## Of weary ways or golden days,## Before His face I see.</verse>
    <verse> I know not when my Lord may come,## At night or noonday fair,## Nor if I walk the vale with Him,## Or meet Him in the air.</verse>
