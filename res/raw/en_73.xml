    <verse>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;## The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.## When other helpers fail and comforts flee,## Help of the helpless, O abide with me.</verse>
    <verse>Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;## Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;## Change and decay in all around I see;## O Thou who changest not, abide with me.</verse>
    <verse>Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,## But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,## Familiar, condescending, patient, free.## Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.</verse>
    <verse>Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,## But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;## Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea.## Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me</verse>
    <verse>Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,## And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,## Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.## On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.</verse>
	<verse>I need Thy presence every passing hour.## What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?## Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?## Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.</verse>
