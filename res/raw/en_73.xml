    <verse>The Lord has done so much for me,## Forever shall I love Him.## He died for me on Calvary;## Forever shall I love Him. </verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Forever shall I love Him,## Jesus Christ, my Saviour;## Forever shall I love Him,## For He did so much for me.</verse>
    <verse>He saved my life from death and hell;## Forever shall I love Him.## He healed my soul and made me well;## Forever shall I love Him.</verse>
    <verse>He keeps and guards me every day;## Forever shall I love Him.## Restores my strength and leads the way;## Forever shall I love Him</verse>
    <verse>There is no friend like Christ, my Lord;## Forever shall I love Him.## He is my stronghold and support;## Forever shall I love Him</verse>
    <verse>Though many might forsake my God,## Forever shall I love Him.## In spite of any painful lot,## Forever shall I love Him.</verse>
