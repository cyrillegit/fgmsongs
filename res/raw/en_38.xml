    <verse>Oh, what fellowship, oh, what joy is mine,## Resting in the everlasting arms!## Oh, what blessedness; oh, what peace divine,## Resting in the everlasting arms!</verse>
    <verse>Resting, resting,## Safe and secure from all alarms;## Resting, resting,## Resting in the everlasting arms!</verse>
    <verse>Oh, how safe am I in this pilgrim way,## Resting in the everlasting arms!## Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day,## Resting in the everlasting arms!</verse>
    <verse>What have I to dread, what have I to fear,## Resting in the everlasting arms!## I have perfect peace with my Saviour near,## Resting in the everlasting arms!</verse>
