    <verse> When we walk with the Lord, ## In the light of His word, ## What a glory He sheds on our way! ## While we do His good will, ## He abides with us still, ## And with all who will trust and obey.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Trust and obey; ## For there's no other way## To be happy in Jesus, ## But to trust and obey</verse>
    <verse>Not a shadow can rise, ## Not a cloud in the skies, ## But His smile quickly drives it away; ## Not a doubt nor a fear, ## Not a sigh nor a tear, ## Can abide while we trust and obey.</verse>
    <verse>But we never can prove## The delights of His love## Until all on the altar we lay; ## For the favour He shows, ## And the joy He bestows, ## Are for them who will trust and obey.</verse>
    <verse>Then in fellowship sweet## We will sit at His feet, ## Or we'll walk by His side in the way; ## What He says we will do, ## Where He sends we will go, ## Never fear, only trust and obey.</verse>
