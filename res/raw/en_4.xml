<song>
    <verse>There is a name I love to hear, ## I love to sing its worth; ## It sounds like music in mine ear, ## The sweetest name on earth.</verse>
    <verse>Oh, how I love Jesus, (x3) ## Because He first loved me.</verse>
    <verse>It tells me of a Savior’s love, ## Who died to set me free; ## It tells me of His precious blood, ## The sinner's perfect plea.</verse>
    <verse>It tells me what my Father hath## In store for every day, ## And though I tread a darksome path, ## Yields sunshine all the way.</verse>
    <verse>It tells of one whose loving heart## Can feel my deepest woe, ## Who in each sorrow bears a part, ## That none can bear below. </verse>
    <verse>It bids my trembling heart rejoice. ## It dries each rising tear. ## It tells me, in a “still small voice,” ## To trust and never fear.</verse>
    <verse>This Name shall shed its fragrance still## Along this thorny road, ## Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill## That leads me up to God. </verse>
    <verse>And there with all the blood-bought throng, ## From sin and sorrow free, ## I’ll sing the new eternal song## Of Jesus’ love for me.</verse>
