    <verse> Down at the cross where my Saviour died,## Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,## There to my heart was the blood applied;## Glory to His name! (x3)## There to my heart was the blood applied;## Glory to His name!</verse>
    <verse>I am so wondrously saved from sin,## Jesus so sweetly abides within,## There at the cross where He took me in;## Glory to His name! (x3)## There at the cross where He took me in;## Glory to His name!</verse>
    <verse>Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,## I am so glad I have entered in;## There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;## Glory to His name! (x3)## There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;## Glory to His name!</verse>
    <verse>Come to this fountain so rich and sweet;## Cast thy poor soul at the Saviourâ€™s feet;## Plunge in to-day and be made complete;## Glory to His name! (x3)## Plunge in to-day and be made complete;## Glory to His name!</verse>
