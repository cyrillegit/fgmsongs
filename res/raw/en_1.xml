    <verse>Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it,## Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;## Redeemed through His infinite mercy,## His child and forever I am.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Redeemed, redeemed,## Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.## Redeemed, redeemed;## His child and forever I am.</verse>
    <verse>Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,## No language my rapture can tell;## I know that the light of His presence## With me doth continually dwell.</verse>
    <verse>I think of my blessèd Redeemer,## I think of Him all the day long;## I sing, for I cannot be silent,## His love is the theme of my song.</verse>
    <verse>I know there’s a crown that is waiting## In yonder bright mansion for me;## And soon with the spirit made perfect,## At home with the Lord I shall be.</verse>
    <verse>I know I shall see in His beauty,## The King in whose law I delight;## Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,## And giveth me songs in the night.</verse>
