    <verse>O come, all ye faithful, ## Joyful and triumphant!## O come ye, ## O come ye to Bethlehem!## Come and behold him## Born the King of Angels:## O come, let us adore Him, ## O come, let us adore Him,## O come, let us adore Him, ## Christ the Lord.</verse>
    <verse>God of God, ## Light of light,## Lo, he abhors ## Not the Virgin's womb;## Very God, ## Begotten, not created:## O come, let us adore Him, ## O come, let us adore Him,## O come, let us adore Him, ## Christ the Lord.</verse>
    <verse>Sing, choirs of angels, ## Sing in exultation,## Sing, all ye citizens ## Of Heaven above!## Glory to God ## In the highest:## O come, let us adore Him, ## O come, let us adore Him,7## O come, let us adore Him, ## Christ the Lord.</verse>
    <verse>Yea, Lord, we greet thee, ## Born this happy morning;## Jesus, to thee ## Be glory given!## Word of the Father, ## Now in flesh appearing!## O come, let us adore Him, ## O come, let us adore Him,## O come, let us adore Him, ## Christ the Lord.</verse>
