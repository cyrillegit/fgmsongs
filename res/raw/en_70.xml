    <verse>A pilgrim was I, and was wandering,## In the cold night of sin I did roam,## When Jesus Christ the kind Shepherd found me,## And now here I am on my way home.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me,## All the days, all the days of my life. (x2)</verse>
    <verse>Jesus restores my soul when I’m weary,## My Saviour gives me strength day by day;## Jesus leads me besides the still waters,## And He guards me each step of the way.</verse>
    <verse>When I walk through the dark lonesome valley,## My Redeemer will walk with me there;## And safely His mighty hand will lead me## To the mansions He’s gone to prepare.</verse>
    <verse>FINAL REFRAIN : And I shall dwell in the house of God forever,## And I shall feast at the table spread for me.## Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me## All the days, all the days of my life.</verse>
