    <verse>What a friend we have in Jesus, ## All our sins and griefs to bear! ## What a privilege to carry## Everything to God in prayer! ## Oh, what peace we often forfeit, ## Oh, what needless pain we bear -## All because we do not carry ## Everything to God in prayer!</verse>
    <verse>Have we trials and temptations? ## Is there trouble anywhere? ## We should never be discouraged; ## Take it to the Lord in prayer! ## Can we find a friend so faithful, ## Who will all our sorrows share? ## Jesus knows our every weakness -## Take it to the Lord in prayer! </verse>
    <verse>Are we weak and heavy laden, ## Cumbered with a load of care? ## Precious Savior still our refuge -## Take it to the Lord in prayer; ## Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? ## Take it to the Lord in prayer; ## In His arms He'll take and shield thee, ## Thou wilt find a solace there.</verse>
    <verse>Since we’ve been justified through faith,## We have peace with God through Christ,## Who at the right time died for us,## To set us free from all sin.## If we earnestly seek the Lord,## And if our soul thirsts for Him,## He will answer all our prayers,## And give us the victory. </verse>
    <verse>Blessèd Savior, Thou hast promised## Thou wilt all our burdens bear, ## May we ever, Lord, be bringing## All to Thee in earnest prayer. ## Soon in glory bright unclouded, ## There will be no need for prayer; ## Rapture, praise and endless worship## Will be our sweet portion there.</verse>
    <verse>What a friend we have in Jesus,## Blessèd Saviour always near,## As He promised, He is coming## Back soon to take us with Him.## What a great joy that’ll be for us,## When we see Him face to face,## And we’ll be like Him in glory,## In His presence forever!</verse>
