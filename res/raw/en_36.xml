    <verse>Bless√®d assurance, Jesus is mine!## Oh what a fore-taste of glory divine!## Heir of salvation, purchase of God,## Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.</verse>
    <verse>This is my story,## this is my song,## Praising my Saviour ## all the day long. (bis)</verse>
    <verse>Perfect submission, perfect delight,## Visions of rapture, burst on my sight;## Angels descending bring from above## Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.</verse>
    <verse>Perfect submission, all is at rest,## I in my Saviour am happy and blest.## Watching and waiting, looking above,## Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</verse>
