    <verse>The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide:## A shelter in the time of storm!## Secure whatever ill betide:## A shelter in the time of storm!</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : Jesus Christ is the Rock in a weary land,## A weary land, a weary land;## Jesus Christ is the Rock in a weary land,## A shelter in the time of storm!</verse>
    <verse>A shade by day, defense by night,## A shelter in the time of storm!## No fears alarm, no foes affright:## A shelter in the time of storm!</verse>
    <verse>A raging storms may round us beat:## A shelter in the time of storm!## We'll never leave our safe retreat,## A shelter in the time of storm!</verse>
    <verse>O Rock divine, O Refuge dear:## A shelter in the time of storm!## Be Thou our helper ever near,## A shelter in the time of storm.</verse>
