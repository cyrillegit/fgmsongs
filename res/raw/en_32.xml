    <verse>All to Jesus I surrender, ## All to Him I freely give; ## I will ever love and trust Him, ## In His presence daily live.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : I surrender all, I surrender all, ## All to Thee, my blessèd Saviour, ## I surrender all.</verse>
    <verse>All to Jesus I surrender, ## Humbly at His feet I bow; ## Worldly pleasures all forsaken, ## Take me Jesus, take me now!</verse>
    <verse>All to Jesus I surrender, ## Lord, I’ll ever hope in Thee, ## Oh, while I was still a sinner, ## In due time Thou died for me.</verse>
    <verse>All to Jesus I surrender, ## Make me, Savior wholly Thine; ## Let the Holy Spirit witness, ## I am Thine and Thou art mine. </verse>
    <verse>All to Jesus I surrender, ## Lord, I give myself to Thee; ## Fill me with Thy love and power, ## Let Thy blessing fall on me. </verse>
    <verse>All to Jesus I surrender, ## Now I feel the sacred flame. ## Ah, the joy of full salvation! ## Glory, glory to His name!</verse>
