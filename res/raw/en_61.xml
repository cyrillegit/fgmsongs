    <verse>Thereâ€™s a land that is fairer than day,## And by faith we can see it afar;## For the Father waits over the way,## To prepare us a dwelling place there.</verse>
    <verse>CHORUS : In the sweet by-and-by,## We shall meet on that beautiful shore.## In the sweet by-and-by,## We shall meet on that beautiful shore.</verse>
    <verse>We shall sing on that beautiful shore## The melodious songs of the blest,## And our spirits shall sorrow no more,## Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.</verse>
    <verse>To our bountiful Father above,## We will offer the tribute of praise## For the glorious gift of His love,## And the blessings that hallow our days.</verse>
