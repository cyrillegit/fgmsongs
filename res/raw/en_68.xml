    <verse>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,## When sorrows like sea billows roll;## Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,## It is well, it is well, with my soul.</verse>
    <verse>It is well, with my soul, (x2)## It is well, it is well, with my soul.</verse>
    <verse>My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!## My sin, not in part but the whole,## Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,## Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</verse>
    <verse>For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:## If Jordan above me shall roll,## No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life,## Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.</verse>
    <verse>But, Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,## The sky, not the grave, is our goal;## Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!## Blessèd hope, blessèd rest of my soul!</verse>
