<song>
    <verse>Nearer my God to Thee, nearer to Thee;## E'en though it be a cross, that raiseth me,## Still all my song shall be,## Nearer, my God, to Thee.## Nearer, my God, to Thee! Nearer to Thee!</verse>
    <verse>Though, like the wanderer, the sun gone down,## Darkness be over me, my rest a stone,## Yet in my dream I'd be## Nearer, my God, to Thee.## Nearer, my God, to Thee! Nearer to Thee!</verse>
    <verse>There let the way appear steps unto heaven;## All that Thou sendest me in mercy given;## Angels to beckon me;## Nearer, my God, to Thee.## Nearer, my God, to Thee! Nearer to Thee!</verse>
    <verse>Then with my waking thoughts## Bright with Thy praise,## Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;## So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee;## Nearer, my God, to Thee! Nearer to Thee!</verse>
    <verse>There in my Father’s home, safe and at rest,## There in my Savior’s love, perfectly blest;## Age after age to be,## Nearer my God to Thee.## Nearer, my God, to Thee! Nearer to Thee!</verse>
